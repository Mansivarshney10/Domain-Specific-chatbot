# Domain-Specific-chatbot

## Overview
This project implements a **domain-specific chatbot** designed to answer questions and assist users within a focused domain. The chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) and AI to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

## Features
- Understands and responds to queries in a specific domain.
- Supports context-aware conversation.
- Easy to extend to other domains by updating the knowledge base.
- Lightweight and efficient for Jupyter Notebook usage.

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- NLP libraries: `transformers`, `nltk`, `spacy`
- Machine Learning: Optional pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT, BERT)
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and testing

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/domain-chatbot.git
cd domain-chatbot

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
1. Open chatbot_notebook.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Interact with the chatbot by typing your queries in the input cell.
4. The chatbot will return answers based on the domain-specific knowledge base.

# Example usage in Jupyter Notebook
user_input = "What is the process for X?"
response = chatbot.get_response(user_input)
print(response)
